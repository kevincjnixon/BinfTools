\title{Correlation Plotting
Plot a correlation bewteen any two columns from any data frame(s) or named vectors}
\usage{
plotCor(
  x,
  y,
  xCol = FALSE,
  yCol = FALSE,
  xlab = "",
  ylab = "",
  title = "",
  scale = FALSE,
  showP = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data frame with rownames or named vector containing data to be plotted on the x-axis}

\item{y}{Data frame with rownames or named vector containing data to be plotted on the y-axis}

\item{xCol}{Character indicating column name in x of data to be plotted on the x-axis. Leave FALSE if x is a named vector.}

\item{yCol}{Character indicating column name in y of data to be plotted on the y-axis. Leave FALSE if y is a named vector.}

\item{xlab}{Character indicating x-axis label}

\item{ylab}{Character indicating y-axis label}

\item{title}{Character indicating title of plot}

\item{scale}{Should the data be z-score scaled? Default is FALSE.}

\item{showP}{Boolean indicating if the p-value should also be displayed (Default = FALSE)}
}
\value{
Scatter plot of data with line of best fit and R-value of correlation. Note that x and y data are paired based on the rownames of the data frame or names of the named vector. Non-paired values will not be plotted.
